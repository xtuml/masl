//! The Petrol Station Control domain manages the dispensing of
//! petrol, customer payments and tank levels.
//! 
//! Before a customer can use the self-service pumps, the pump
//! must be enabled by the attendant.  When a pump is enabled,
//! the pump motor is started, if it is not already on, with the
//! pump clutch free.  When the trigger in the gun is depressed,
//! closing a micro switch, the clutch is engaged and petrol
//! pumped.  When it is released, the clutch is freed.  There is
//! also a micro switch on the holster in which the gun is kept
//! which prevents petrol being pumped until the gun is taken
//! out.  Once the gun is replaced in the holster, the delivery
//! is deemed to be completed and the pump disabled.  Further
//! depressions of the trigger in the gun cannot dispense more
//! petrol.  After a short standby period, the pump motor will
//! be turned off unless the pump is re-enabled.
//! 
//! A metering device in the petrol line sends a pulse to the
//! system for each 1/100 litre dispensed.  The cost of the fuel
//! is calculated using the amount delivered and unit cost which
//! is displayed on the pump.
//! 
//! There are two kinds of pump.  The normal kind allows the
//! user to dispense petrol ad lib.  The sophisticated pumps,
//! imported from New Zealand, allow the customer to preset an
//! amount and a volume of petrol.  Petrol will then be pumped
//! up to a maximum of the required quantity.
//! 
//! Transactions are stored until the customer pays.  Payment
//! may be either in cash, by credit card or account.  A
//! customer may request a receipt (showing price, time, date
//! etc.) and will get a token for every 5 pounds.  Customers
//! sometimes abscond without paying and the operator must
//! annotate the transaction with any available information, the
//! vehicle's registration number for example.  At the end of
//! the day, transactions are archived and may be used for ad
//! hoc enquiries on sales.
//! 
//! At present, two grades of petrol are dispensed from five
//! pumps on the forecourt.  Each pump takes its supply from one
//! of two tanks, one tank for each grade.  The tank level must
//! not drop below 4% of the tank's capacity.  If this happens,
//! the pumps serviced by that tank cannot be enabled to
//! dispense petrol.
