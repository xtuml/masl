<!--
    This configuration will send all messages to syslog, and anything with a
    priority of information or higher to stderr. syslog messages are
    formatted with detailed information, and stderr ones with a simpler form.
    Note that in general syslog should not have its messages filtered, as it
    has its own mechanisms for this.
