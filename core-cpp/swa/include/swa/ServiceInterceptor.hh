// *****************************************************************
//! \brief A domain service invocation router.
//!
//! Invocations of domain services need to be bound at runtime rather than compile
//! time to allow for the insertion of test stubs during unit testing and the replacement 
//! of local implementations with their remote counter-parts. This templated class
//! provides the required functionality. 
//! 
//! An instance of this class is created for each domain based service. An example 
//! specialisation of the ServiceInterceptor templated class is shown below. 
//!
//!   typedef ::SWA::ServiceInterceptor<masls_tune_receiver_tag,void (int32_t,int32_t,int32_t)> maslsi_tune_receiver;
//!
//! At the call sites for this method a direct invocation of the method is replaced 
//! with a call to the associated Interceptors callService method.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//!       I_RXC::masls_tune_receiver(receiver_id,frequency,scale);
//!
//! would be replaced by
//!
//!       I_RXC::maslsi_tune_receiver::instance().callService(receiver_id,frequency,scale);
//!
//! The interceptor class is populated with the required methods, via a static registration
//! mechanism based on which libraries are included within an executable. The callService
//! method will therefore invoke whichever implementation has been registered. If a local
//! implementation is found, then this will be called, otherwise the call is forwarded to
//! the remote implementation. If no servcie is found then an exception will be raised.
//!
//! It is also possible to include both the local and remote implmentations within an executable 
//! and at the MASL level direct the code generator to call the required implementation. This replaces 
//! the generic callService invocation with a specific method invocation based on the information
//! supplied.
//! 
//! For example:
//! 
//!    MASL code     :   I_RXC::tune_receiver(receiver_id,frequency,scale) pragma scope("remote");
//!    Generated c++ :   I_RXC::maslsi_tune_receiver::instance().callRemote(receiver_id,frequency,scale);
//! 
//!    MASL code     :   I_RXC::tune_receiver(receiver_id,frequency,scale) pragma scope("local");
//!    Generated c++ :   I_RXC::maslsi_tune_receiver::instance().callLocal(receiver_id,frequency,scale);
//! 
//!
