//! Domain Regex supplies various functions for manipulating 
//! and searching strings using regular expressions. The 
//! expressions are supplied in Perl format, which provides 
//! such capabilities as lookahead, cub-expression captures, 
//! non-greedy matching and conditional expressions. 
//!
//! Creation of a new regular expression is relatively 
//! expensive, so regular expressions are not created until 
//! they are actually used in a match, and previously used 
//! expressions are cached. Once the maximum cache size has 
//! been reached, the least recently used expression will age 
//! off. The default max cache size is 100 regexes, but this 
//! can be changed at process startup by means of the 
//! -regex-cache-size command line option. 
domain Regex is
  
  //! Type to hold a regular expression. Regular expressions 
  //! should be specified in Perl regex syntax, which is superset of 
  //! the POSIX Extended format. 
  type regex is string;

  //! Type to hold a format string. Formats are specified in Perl format.
  //!
  //! Perl-style format strings treat all characters as literals except '$' and '\' which start placeholder and escape sequences respectively.
  //!
  //!    Placeholder sequences specify that some part of what matched the regular expression should be sent to output as follows:

  //!    \x{DDDD}  Outputs the character whose hexadecimal code point is 0xDDDDD
  //!    \cX       Outputs the ANSI escape sequence "escape-X".
  //!    \D        If D is a decimal digit in the range 1-9, then outputs the text that matched sub-expression D.
  //!    \l        Causes the next character to be outputted, to be output in lower case.
  //!    \u        Causes the next character to be outputted, to be output in upper case.
